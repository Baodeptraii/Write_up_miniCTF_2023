This is the hardest one for sure
I'm not play LOL anymore but YASUO have a famous line right ?

Open YASUO with Notepad and you will see 5 pieces of cake he gave us :
Death_is_like_the_wind-always_by_my_side/piece1.jpg
Death_is_like_the_wind-always_by_my_side/piece2.mp3
Death_is_like_the_wind-always_by_my_side/piece3.zip
Death_is_like_the_wind-always_by_my_side/piece4.png
Death_is_like_the_wind-always_by_my_side/piece5.png

But how do we open theses file which is hidden in a image ( YASUOOOOOOO ) ?
Open Kali Linux and use this line "binwalk YASUO.jpg" , we will see what YASUO trying to hide us.
For sure, there are 5 pieces.
To open this "binwalk --extract --dd=".*" YASUO.jpg" we can extract all of this into a folder.
Yep, we need to do lot of work to find all the flag.
Piece 1: Just open it
Piece 2: Now i hate Bomman, remove his vocal and decode the Morse
Piece 3: Find the unzip tool on the Internet
Piece 4: Use every Forensnic tool you know
Piece 5: Same as Piece 4

Long work huh
